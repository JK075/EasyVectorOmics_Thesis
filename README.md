# EasyVectorOmics

In Tensor Omics ("EasyVectorOmics"), data becomes geometryâ€”functional shifts unfold as flows in high-dimensional space, and the method itself arises from the structure of the data, allowing multi-omics integration, module detection, and biological insight to emerge natively from the mathematics of direction, divergence, and change.
