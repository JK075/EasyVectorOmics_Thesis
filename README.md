# EasyVectorOmics
EasyVectorOmcis leverages the native geometry of multi-omics data to model how biological function flows and diverges through high-dimensional spaceâ€”using vectors, fields, and curvature to trace evolutionary, developmental, or stress-induced trajectories across transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and phenotypic layers.
